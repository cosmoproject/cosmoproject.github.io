### Workshop description
Currently the workshops are planned for a two-day (each 6 hours) schedule. This includes, designing the interface, soldering the components and learing to setting up the software.

### Design
Our hardware framework allows to connect up to 8 analog control inputs (pots, lightsensors etc.), 8 digital control inputs (switches) and 8 LEDs. The current design uses a HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) audio interface, but any USB soundcard running with the Raspberry Pi is also possible to use. See [Build COSMO](/docs) for more details on the hardware design
