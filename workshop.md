### Workshop description
Currently the workshops are planned for a two-day (each 5 hours) schedule. This includes, designing the interface, soldering the components and learing to setting up the software.

### Designs
The basic design is a guitar pedal with 4 knobs, 2 foot buttons and 2 LEDs. However, according to the avialable components or design ideas from the attendencies, the design is up to you. The COSMO-HAT allows to connect up to 8 analog control inputs (knobs or switches) and 8 LEDs. The current design forsees a stereo USB soundcard, but any multichannel USB soundcard running with the raspberry pi is possible to use and would allow to have more input/output channels.
