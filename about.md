Some information about The COSMO Project!

The COSMO (Csound On Stage Musical Operator) project is an open source project about making a DIY effect pedal using the small and inexpensive computer Raspberry PI running Linux with Csound.

### Background

[Csound](https://csound.com) is a powerful, multi-platform, real-time sound-processing environment that enables musicians to design their own instruments and audio-effects by writing a few lines of [Csound](https://csound.com) code. The initial aim of the “Csound On Stage Music Operator” (COSMO) project was to embed [Csound 6](https://csound.com) into a standalone musical device especially designed for live performance [1].

### COSMO Workshops 

The current design propose a guitar pedal design with regular quarter jack-in and jack-outputs, 3 footswitches and 5 knob potentiometers. Csound 6 (Csound Python API) is running on a Raspberry Pi micro-computer, equipped with an additional sound card for low latency audio input and audio output. An advantage of such a design is the straightforward inclusion of individual designed digital audio-effects (like granular frequency modulation) into a regular live-electronics setup and provide direct haptic control of [Csound](https://csound.com) to the performing musician. Such a musical device may also enable non-programming instrumentalists to use [Csound](https://csound.com) in their analog live-performance setups. 

Do-it-yourself (DIY) build instructions for the pedal-box and a SD-card image with all required software installed and preconfigured, will be provided on the related COSMO project wiki-page. 

We are giving workshops were we assist in building these devices and show how easy it is to design custom audio-effects with [Csound](https://csound.com). This may result in a [Csound](https://csound.com) live-performer community, sharing sound modification [Csound](https://csound.com) patches, developed for such stand alone musical devices [2].
