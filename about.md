The COSMO (Csound On Stage Musical Operator) project is an open source project devoted to make hardware- and software frameworks for designing and building embedded standalone [Csound](https://csound.com) instruments to use on stage.

### Background

[Csound](https://csound.com/) is an audio software and programming language for sound synthesis and composition. It was developed by Barry Vercoe at MIT Media Lab in 1986, but its roots go all the way back to the Music III Software developed by Max Matthews in 1961. 

Today Csound is developed by a group of core developers with a wider community of volunteers contributing. One of the main principles in Csound development is to guarantee backwards compatibility. You can still run Csound source files from 1986 on the latest Csound release.

Although Csound has a strong tradition as a tool for composing electro-acoustic pieces and traditionally has been used in a non-interactive score driven context, nowadays it is mostly used in a real-time context. Csound can run on various different hardware and software platforms including all major operating systems as well as Android and iOS. Csound can also be called through other programming languages such as Python, Lua, C/C++, Java, etc., with the latest addition being being support for the [Bela platform](https://bela.io/).

 The initial aim of the ***Csound On Stage Music Operator*** (COSMO) project was to bring the power of [Csound](https://csound.com) in a seamless and intergrated way. The first version of COSMO was in a classic guitar pedal stomp box design - with the tagline **Csound on the pedal board** - but has since expanded in several ways ranging from [table top effects unit](https://vimeo.com/183101272) to [embedded saxophone augmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_6mvbx8esQ). There's no definite COSMO design in terms of hardware and layout, which has also been a key point in our workshops where the participants have designed their own boxes.

### COSMO Workshops 

The basic scheme proposes either a aluminum guitar pedal design or a laser cut wooden table top design. Both with regular quarter jack-in and jack-outputs, . Csound 6 (Csound Python API) is running on a Raspberry Pi micro-computer, equipped with an additional sound card for low latency audio input and audio output. The advantage of such a design is the straightforward inclusion of individual designed digital audio-effects (like granular frequency modulation) into a regular live-electronics setup and provide direct haptic control of [Csound](https://csound.com) to the performing musician. Such a musical device may also enable non-programming instrumentalists to use [Csound](https://csound.com) in their analog live-performance setups. 

Do-it-yourself (DIY) build instructions for the pedal-box and a SD-card image with all required software installed and preconfigured, will be provided on the [COSMO project github page] (http://cosmoproject.github.io). 

Additionally, we are giving [workshops](http://cosmoproject.github.io/workshop) were we assist in building these devices and show how easy it is to design custom audio-effects with [Csound](https://csound.com). This may result in a [Csound](https://csound.com) live-performer community, sharing sound modification [Csound](https://csound.com) patches, developed for such stand alone musical devices [2].
