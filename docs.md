### Building instructions

COSMO is based on our COSMO-HAT circuit. The C-HAT allows to connect up to 8 of any type of analog control inputs (sensors, expression pedals etc.), as well as an array of 8 LEDs. The C-HAT furthermore, supports a MIDI-In and MIDI-Out connection, which makes the COSMO device more flexible for applications like a standalone Csound based synthesizer or for interactive sound installations.
