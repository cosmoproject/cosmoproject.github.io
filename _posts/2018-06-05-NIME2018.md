title: COSMO at NIME 2018

COSMO is once again represented at NIME, this year in Blacksburg in Virginia Tech. Bernt Isak is perfoming with acoustic guitar and two COSMO's - one them the first one built around the [Bela platform](https://bela.io/). We'll come back with more news on that later!

Some pictures from NIME 2018:
