title: COSMO Image updated
---

The COSMO Rasbian Image has been updated to include version 6.08 of Csound. We've also cleaned up the home folder and both repositories, [cosmo-dsp](https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp/) and [cosmo-fw](https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-fw/) (previous name was cosmohat-fw), quite a bit. 

Go to the [Links](/links) page to download the latest version. To update your SD card with the latest version, go to [section 6.4](/docs/#64-update-entire-image-to-latest-version) of the [Build COSMO](/docs) page
