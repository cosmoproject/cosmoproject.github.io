title: Csound (and COSMO) on Bela 
---

Thanks to the concentrated efforts of Bernt Isak WÃ¦rstad, Victor Lazarini, Alex Hofmann and Giulio Moro over the past year, Csound now runs on the ultra-low latency embedded computing platform Bela. Actually it has for a while already, but we haven't talked to much about it until now. 

We've put together an introduction for how to use Csound and our cosmo-dsp library on the amazing Bela platform! Also includes some of recent projects done with Bela and Csound like an embedded COSMO-saxophone!
