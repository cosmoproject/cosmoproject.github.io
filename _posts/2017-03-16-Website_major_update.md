title: Major update of documentation
---

The documentation pages, [Build COSMO](/docs) and [Program COSMO](/dsp), have just been completely reworked. The documentation is mainly for the building of a COSMO box, but it also covers some general startup issues for using Raspberry Pi and Csound. In particular our [DSP-library](https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp) and new toolset [COSMO Patcher](dsp/#1-cosmo-patcher) should be equally useful on any platform. 

If you find any bugs/typos/errors, think something is unclear or miss some topic from the documentation, please let us know! 

You can e-mail us on **```csoundonstage (at) gmail.com```**
