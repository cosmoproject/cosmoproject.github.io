### Introduction to effect processing with Csound and the cosmo-dsp library


<img src="http://cosmoproject.github.io/images/COSMO-box-small-nopadding.png" style="border:0;width:75%;height:75%">

In this workshop, participants will get a basic introduction to Csound and how they can use the **cosmo-dsp** library to quickly build simple and more complex effect processing patches. The modular design of the library makes it very quick to set up a complex patch, while at the same time keeping it open for further customisation. Since Csound is integrable in a multitude of platforms (eg. Win, Linux, Mac, IOS, Android, Bela, Intel Galileo) and also into other programming languages (python, c/ c++, Unity, web, VST/AU (Cabbage), Max/MSP, and more), platforms can easily be interchanged when using Csound based set ups. To top it off, Csound has a guarantee for backwards compatibility (code from 1986 still runs on the latest version from late 2018), so your patches are easy to move in both time and space!

### What is COSMO?

The COSMO Project (Csound On Stage: Music Operator) is an open-source DIY project providing hardware- and software frameworks for designing and building embedded standalone Csound instruments for on stage use cases.To make this project more accessible to musicians with little or no programming experience, an effect library (named cosmo-dsp ) consisting of readymade “plug-and-play” effect modules was designed. Using Csound code wrapped as UDOs (User Defined Opcodes) and normalized parameter controls (similar to CV in modular synths) allows for a very flexible and easy way of patching effects together using very few lines of code.

### What is Csound?


[Csound](https://csound.com/) is an audio software and programming language for sound synthesis and composition. It was developed by Barry Vercoe at MIT Media Lab in 1986, but its roots go all the way back to the Music Software developed by Max Matthews at Bell Labs from 1957 and onwards. 

Today Csound is developed by a group of core developers with a wider community of volunteers contributing. One of the main principles in Csound development is to guarantee backwards compatibility. You can still run Csound source files from 1986 on the latest Csound release.

Although Csound has a strong tradition as a tool for composing electro-acoustic pieces and traditionally has been used in a non-interactive score driven context, nowadays it is mostly used in a real-time context. Csound can run on various different hardware and software platforms including all major operating systems as well as Android and iOS. Csound can also be called through other programming languages such as Python, Lua, C/C++, Java, etc. and is now also supported on the [Bela](https://bela.io/) platform!

### Installing Csound and cosmo-dsp

Go to [https://csound.com/download.html](https://csound.com/download.html) and download the appropriate installer for your system. Follow the instructions given by the installer. Open the terminal/command line and type in ```csound```. If Csound installed correctly, you should see something like this:

### Writing a Csound instrument
Csound documents are simple text documents starting with the XML type tag ```<CsoundSynthesizer>``` and are then structured into 3 sections:  ```<CsOptions>```, ```<CsInstruments>``` and ```<CsScore>```

```
<CsoundSynthesizer>

<CsOptions>
</CsOptions>

<CsInstruments>
</CsInstruments>  

<CsScore>
</CsScore>

</CsoundSynthesizer>
```

Each section of Csound code has its on [syntax and grammar](https://csound.com/get-started.html). The first couple of lines in ```<CsOptions>``` are mainly some [hardware/software settings](https://csound.com/docs/manual/Using.html), which for now we can ignore.

Where the fun starts is in the ```<CsInstruments>``` section with defining instruments (or setting up patches). An new instrument is defined between the ```instr``` and ```endin``` lines (see example below). Instruments are built by combining signal processing modules which are called *opcodes* in Csound. There are [thousands of opcodes](https://csound.com/docs/manual/PartOpcodesOverview.html) available for different kinds of oscillators, filters, envelopes, delays, reverbs, sample manipulation tools and so on. The [Csound Reference Manual](https://csound.com/docs/manual/PartReference.html) provides more information and examples for each available opcode.

#### A very simple Csound instrument

Here is a complete example of a very simple Csound instrument which takes in audio from the sound card, scale it and passes it back out

	<CsoundSynthesizer>
	<CsOptions>
    -iadc0 ; Set up audio in
	-odac0 ; Set up audio out
    -b128 ; Buffer size
	</CsOptions>
	<CsInstruments>
	ksmps  	= 32 ; Vector size
	0dbfs	= 1 ; Set 0dbfs reference to 1
	nchnls 	= 2 ; Number of audio channels

	instr 1 ; Start a definition of instrument with number 1

        ; Control variable for gaining the signal
        kGain = 0.1 
        
        ; Opcode (ins) for getting stereo sound in
        aL, aR ins  

        aL *= kGain ; Gaining left channel
        aR *= kGain ; Gaining right channel

        ; Opcode (outs) for sending stereo sound out
        outs aL, aR 
        
	endin ; End instrument definition

	</CsInstruments>
	<CsScore>
    ; Set instrument 1 to run for 86400 seconds (24 hours)
	i1 0 86400
	</CsScore>
	</CsoundSynthesizer>

**NB!** If you're not wearing a headset you'll get a feedback sound - make sure to turn down the volume on your computer!

To run this example, open your terminal/command line, navigate to the example folder you downloaded earlier and type

#### Building a simple effect processor using the COSMO dsp-library

The [cosmo-dsp repository](http://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp) comprises a library of ready-made audio effects (e.g Reverb, Delay, Distortion, Filters etc.). All effects are set up as independendant modules that can be combined to a custom setup of effects. To make it as much plug and play as possible, all arguments are also normalized (0-1) and scaled properly inside the effect so that the user can use them immediately.

To use one of the readymade effects, you first need to download the file containing the desired effect, place it with your csd file and include it using ```#include``` like this:

	#include "Reverb.udo"

Alternatively you can download the whole repository and include all the effects like this:

    #include "cosmo-dsp/DSP-Library/Includes/cosmo-dsp.inc"

The name and a quick explanation of the arguments can be found in the header of each ```.udo``` file in the COSMO dsp-library (e.g. [```Reverb.udo``` ](https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp/blob/master/DSP-Library/Effects/Reverb.udo)). A full list of all the effects available and their arguments can be found at [https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp/blob/master/DSP-Library/README.md](https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp/blob/master/DSP-Library/README.md)

To get control data from a MIDI controller (CC), we first need to add the ```-M``` flag in the ```<CsOptions>``` section:

    <CsOptions>
	-Ma
	</CsOptions>

We can either specify a specific MIDI device by using number or, like here, just use ```a``` to open all available MIDI devices

To read in actual MIDI control data, we can use the ```ctrl7``` opcode:

    kMIDI_pot ctrl7 1, 64, 0, 1

The first argument is MIDI channel, second the CC number, third minimum value and fourth maximum value. If you don't know these values, use a MIDI monitor - see [Links section](#Links).

Since all arguments are normalized between 0 and 1, we're setting the maximum value to be 1 instead of 127, which is the normal MIDI maximum value. Here is a complete example of a Reverb effect where the dry/wet mix is controlled by a MIDI controller on channel 1 and CC 64.

	<CsoundSynthesizer>
	<CsOptions>
	-iadc0 -odac0 -Ma -b128
	</CsOptions>
	<CsInstruments>
	ksmps  	= 32
	0dbfs	= 1
	nchnls 	= 2

	#include "cosmo-dsp/DSP-Library/Includes/cosmo-dsp.inc"

	instr 1 
		aL, aR ins

		kMix ctrl7 1, 64, 0, 1

		; Reverb arguments: decay, cutoff, mix
		aL, aR Reverb aL, aR, 0.9, 0.5, kMix 

		outs aL, aR
	endin


	</CsInstruments>
	<CsScore>
	i1 0 86400
	</CsScore>
	</CsoundSynthesizer>

**NB!** If you're not wearing a headset you'll get a feedback sound - make sure to turn down the volume on your computer!

To run this example, open your terminal/command line, navigate to the example folder you downloaded earlier and type 

    csound SimpleCOSMOExample.csd


The same approach applies to any of the other effects found at [https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp/tree/master/DSP-Library/Effects](https://github.com/cosmoproject/cosmo-dsp/tree/master/DSP-Library/Effects) and you can combine them in any order.
